Now, Hogeland steps back to the inception of the US, and the central role Hamilton played in establishing a financial system that centered on the use of national debt to leverage the economic ambitions of the capitalist class in favor of a nationalist project by allowing them massive ownership stakes, while additionally reinforcing the elitist and anti-democratic makeup of the political class that Hamilton desired. After expanding on Hamilton\u2019s relationship to the US Constitution, including unpacking the relatively subdued role that the Federalist Papers played in the actual ratification, Hogeland walks Sam and Emma through the backlashed faced by the US Federal government due to Hamilton\u2019s wildly anti-democratic financial scheme, looking to both Shays\u2019 Rebellion in 1786 and the Whiskey Rebellion in 1791 as clear cut examples of a coherent dissent and attack on Hamilton\u2019s system of debt and regressive taxation, demanding follow through on the demand of \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d that Americans had fought for, also briefly touching on the greater makeup of this pro-democracy labor movement led by folks with Herman Husband and Thomas Payne. Next, Hogeland looks back to the enemies Hamilton had inside of the US political structures, from State Sovereigntists during the framing of the Constitution, to the Jeffersonian attempts to undermine and overturn his financial system throughout the start of the 19th Century, before wrapping up with the redemption of Hamilton\u2019s legacy over the last few decades, and the particular role his thought played in the US\u2019 response to the 2008 Financial crisis.\n\nWatch the Majority Report live Monday\u2013Friday at 12 p.m. EST on YouTube OR listen via daily podcast at http://www.Majority.FM \n\nhttps://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\nhttps://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm\n\n#SamSeder #EmmaVigeland #MajorityReport #politics #news\n\nSupport the show by becoming a member: https://www.fans.fm/majority/join \n\nFind out more about the Princeton hunger strikers & their demands here: https://www.instagram.com/princetondivestnow/ \n\nHelp out the state of Utah by telling them what you see in public bathrooms here!: https://ut-sao-special-prod.web.app/sex_basis_complaint2.html \n\nCheck out this GoFundMe in support of Mohammed Nasrallah, whose family is trying to leave Gaza for Egypt: https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-mohammed-nasserallah-and-family-go-to-egypt \n\nCheck out this GoFundMe in support of Mohammad Aldaghma\u2019s niece in Gaza, who has Down Syndrome: https://www.gofundme.com/f/yyxhnf-help-me-evacuate-my-family-from-gaza?utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&amp;utm_content=control1&amp;utm_medium=sms&amp;utm_source=customer \n\nCheck out the \u201cRepair Gaza\u201d campaign courtesy of the Glia Project here: https://www.launchgood.com/campaign/rebuild_gaza_help_repair_and_rebuild_the_lives_and_work_of_our_glia_team#!/ \n\nCheck out StrikeAid here!; https://www.strikeaid.com/ \n\nGift a Majority Report subscription here: https://www.fans.fm/majority/gift \n\nSubscribe to the AMQuickie newsletter here: https://www.am-quickie.ghost.io/ \n\nJoin the Majority Report Discord! http://www.majoritydiscord.com/ \n\nGet all your MR merch at our store: https://www.shop.majorityreportradio.com/ \n\nGet the free Majority Report App!: http://www.majority.fm/app \n\nCHECK OUT MORE from the MR crew: \nMatt Binder DOOMED https://www.youtube.com/MattBinder \nBrandon Sutton DISCOURSE https://www.patreon.com/ExpandTheDiscourse \nEmma Vigeland ESVN https://www.youtube.com/ESVNShow \nMatt Lech LEFT RECKONING https://www.youtube.com/LeftReckoning \n\nOTHER LINKS: \nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/themajorityreport \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/MajorityReport \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/MajorityFM \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/majorityreport.fm/\n\nImage Credit, picryl\nhttps://picryl.com/media/alexander-hamilton-2020-c1b30f\nhttps://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/\nImage has been cropped and color has been altered.",
